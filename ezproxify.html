<title>EZProxify Tool</title>
<p><font face="arial"><font face="arial"> <b>The New, Improved EZProxify Tool!</b></font></font></p>
<hr />
<p><font face="arial"><font face="arial">EZProxify is a tool that lets you generate a short URL from results pages within our subscribed databases that take the remote user through our EZProxy authentication service (otherwise, they'd be rejected by Gale, Ebsco, etc.). This works with many, but not all of our services.</font></font></p>

<p><a href="javascript:void(location.href='http://bitly.com/http://proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/login?url=
'+location.href)">EZProxify (bit.ly)</a> (Drag this link to your bookmarks bar)</p>
<p>When you are visiting a page within a library database and want to link to it, click the EZProxify link and you will be taken to bitly.com. From there, just click the Shorten button and you will get a compact link that you can share. If you follow the link from off campus, you will be prompted to log-in using your directory ID and password and you will then go straight to the page you linked to.</p>
